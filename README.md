# cacheai



# This project was developed during a global case competition where our team placed third among a competitive field of international participants. In just one week, we worked cross functionally to design a strategic product roadmap, define high impact MVP features, and develop a prototype for CacheAI, a startup focused on empowering digital creators through data driven insights and monetization tools. Our work stood out for its clarity, scalability, and user centered design. As a result, we were the only team invited by the founder to continue working with the startup beyond the competition.
